# Cody Graham - Data Analysis Portfolio

## **About**

Hi, I'm Cody! I hold a bachelors degree from Brigham Young University-Idaho, with a major in Finance and a minor in Computer Information Technology. My professional data experience began in 2017 as a student while working for the university I attended. My first opportunity to see direct results of leveraging data came after I created and monitored a simple database that tracked and categorized course registration errors which allowed the department to gain real-time knowledge in the most frequent issues students encountered. This led to the subsequent rollout of several website UI enhancements and a new opt-in text message alert system which reduced student interactions with the Registration team by about 70% in a year. Of this experience came a passion for using data to solve problems. Today, I work as a Data Analyst for a pharmacy benefit consulting firm managing over $100 billion in total drug spend.

This repository serves as a platform to share my projects, shaowcase my skills, and track my progress in the world of data analytics.
